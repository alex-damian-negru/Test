# Given an array of numbers having size N in which every number is between 1 and N, determine if there are any duplicates in it. 
# - Do not sort the array or use bit vectors.
# - Do not use 2 nesting for loops since the time complexity would be high.
# - You are allowed to destroy the array if you like.
# - Try to work within the array without using any other temporary data structures.
# - Try to find a solution by executing just one loop.
